<h2>Stripe for WordPress</h2>
<p>
    This is a Stripe plugin for WordPress. A lightweight E-Commerce solution. Instead of managing both WordPress Products and products / subscription in Stripe, have Stripe handle everything!
</p>

<h3>API</h3>
<p>
    This plugin utilizes both the <strong>WordPress REST API</strong> and <strong>Stripe PHP Lib API</strong> to make sure your data is up to date.
</p>

<h3>REST API Endpoints</h3>
<p>
    I have created a few endpoins if you want to extend. All under the `stripe-wp` namespace
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>stripe-wp/settings</strong> - save the secret keys and mode</li>
    <li><strong>stripe-wp/customers</strong> - GET customers</li>
    <li><strong>stripe-wp/customers/:id</strong> - GET customer |  POST to save customer | DELETE a customer</li>
    <li><strong>stripe-wp/plans</strong> - GET plans</li>
    <li><strong>stripe/plans/:id</strong> - GET plan | POST to save plan | DELETE a plan</li>
</ul>
